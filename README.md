My first custom attack lab: Node.js web server on Windows 10, scanned and accessed from Kali Linux
ðŸ’» Lab 01 â€“ Node.js Web Server Recon
Date: May 18, 2025
Goal: Set up a Node.js server on Windows 10 and access it from Kali Linux for scanning and recon.

ðŸ§± Setup
Target Machine: Windows 10 (VMware)
Attacker Machine: Kali Linux (VMware)
Networking: NAT (same subnet)

ðŸ”§ Tools Used
Node.js + Express
Kali Linux
Nmap
Firefox
curl


ðŸ”¥ What I Did
Installed Node.js on Windows 10
Created a basic Express server on port 3000
Disabled Windows Firewall for lab purposes
Found target IP using ipconfig
Accessed the server from Kali via browser + curl
Ran nmap to detect open port
Verified traffic between machines

ðŸ§  Key Takeaways
First successful interaction between attacker and target
Learned how Express serves data and how Kali can access it
Foundation for future attacks (login forms, BurpSuite, fuzzing)
