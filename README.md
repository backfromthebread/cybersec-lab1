My first custom attack lab: Node.js web server on Windows 10, scanned and accessed from Kali Linux
ðŸ’» Lab 01 â€“ Node.js Web Server Recon
Date: May 18, 2025
Goal: Set up a Node.js server on Windows 10 and access it from Kali Linux for scanning and recon.

ðŸ§± Setup

Target Machine: Windows 10 (VMware)

Attacker Machine: Kali Linux (VMware)

Networking: NAT (same subnet)

ðŸ”§ Tools Used
Node.js + Express

Kali Linux

Nmap

Firefox

curl


ðŸ”¥ What I Did

Installed Node.js on Windows 10

Created a basic Express server on port 3000

Disabled Windows Firewall for lab purposes

Found target IP using ipconfig

Accessed the server from Kali via browser + curl

Ran nmap to detect open port

Verified traffic between machines


ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

First successful interaction between attacker and target

Learned how Express serves data and how Kali can access it

Foundation for future attacks (login forms, BurpSuite, fuzzing)
